<h1>Setting Up a Basic Home Lab with Windows Server and Powershell.</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
<b>In this Lab, I will be creating a Simple Home Lab using Windows server to make a Domain Controller and manage an internal Network. A Powershell script is used to make multiple user accound to similate accounts under an Organization.
</b>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell:</b> Creation of Multiple User Accounts  
<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Oracle Vm VirtualBox:</b> Home of the Virtual Machines
- <b>Windows Server:</b> Used to Host and create the Domain

<h2>The Virtual Machine in Azure  </h2>
I made sure to Disable the firewall or made and inbound rule to allow any traffic. This attracts the Attackers as a vulnerable system.
<br />
<br />
<i>When I set up the Virtual Machine, I accidentally gave it only 1 GB of RAM and a single CPU. As I worked on the lab,
I couldn't figure out why the virtual machine was running so slowly. It didn't take long for me to realize the problem and fix it by adjusting the settings. 
This whole process taught me that trial and error can be the best way to learn!
